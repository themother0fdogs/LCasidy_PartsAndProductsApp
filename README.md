TITLE: 
Bicycle Inventory Desktop Application

PURPOSE: 
This is a project is an inventory management system that was created for a fictitious company.  The main purpose is to allow the company to keep track of bike parts and products that they have in stock. When launching the application, the main screen displays a table of parts and products currently in stock. For the bike products, there will be bike parts associated with it; for example, two wheels, two bicycle pedals, and one bike seat. 

The main screen also gives the users the ability to add, modify, or delete items; however, an error message will display if a user tries to delete a product that has parts associated with it. There is also a search bar for users to find a specific part or product that they are looking for on the main screen. 

When adding or modifying a part, there are two radio buttons displaying if the part is "Outsourced" or "In-House" and when clicking one of the buttons, the last label will change to either "Company Name" (for Outsourced) or "Machine ID" (for In-House).
If a user inputs an incorrect data type in the text fields or if the input numbers are illogical, an error message will display. For both parts and products, the ID number is auto-generated and disables that text field for users.

When adding or modifying a product, the user is able to remove or add associated parts to each product. There is also a search bar when adding or modifying a product. The purpose for the search bar is for users to find a specific part they would like to add to their products.
